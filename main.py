print("1. Not all countries are going by their name, but rather their better known name. For example, Holy See, which you may know as Vatican City will be labeled Vatican City.")

print("2. You will get seven tries to guess the country. Each try, you can guess a letter, a dash, or and apostrophe (for example, in Guinea-Bissau or Cote d'Ivoire).")
